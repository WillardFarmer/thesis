\section{Existing Solutions}\label{sec:exsoln}

This is not a problem that is unique to Gray Jay Pathfinder.
For any mission with sufficiently complicated operations, developing or purchasing a license for planning software is prudent.
There are a multitude of existing solutions, each with their own benefits and shortcomings.




\subsection{\acrshort{cpaw}}

The \gls{cpaw} is the one of the most sophisticated operations planning tools on the market. 
Developed by Orbit Logic, \gls{cpaw} is one of their products available on the open market. 
Others being: SpyMeSat Mobile App, Order Logic, STK Scheduler, UAV Planner, and On-board Autonomous Planning System.
\gls{cpaw} has been used by a number of missions for their imaging planning operations: Landsat 8/9 \cite{gokhale_mission_nodate}, Worldview-1/2, GeoEye-1, and RADARSAT-2 \cite{herz_eo_2014}.


\gls{cpaw} specializes specifically on image planning. 
Once set up by an operator, it can generate operations schedules and can generate commands to be sent to spacecraft in orbit.
It supports both automatic and manual operations.
